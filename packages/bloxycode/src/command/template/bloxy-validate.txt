Validate the PRD file at $1 without executing tasks.

If no path is provided, default to PRD.md.

Perform the following validation checks:

1. **File Exists**: Verify the PRD file exists and is readable
2. **Syntax Check**: Validate markdown checkbox format
   - `- [ ]` for pending tasks
   - `- [x]` for completed tasks
   - `- [~]` for deferred tasks
3. **Task Count**: Ensure at least one task is defined
4. **Task Titles**: Each task must have a title
5. **No Duplicates**: Check for duplicate task IDs
6. **Config Validation**: If YAML frontmatter or config section exists, validate it

Report:
- Total tasks found (pending, completed, deferred)
- Any validation errors or warnings
- Whether the PRD is ready for execution

Do NOT start executing tasks. This is a dry-run validation only.
