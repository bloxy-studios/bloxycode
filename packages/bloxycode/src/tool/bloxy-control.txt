Signal task completion or failure in Bloxy autonomous mode.

Use this tool to:
- Signal that the current task has been completed successfully
- Signal that the current task has failed
- Request test execution

Actions:
- `task_complete`: Mark the current task as complete. Include a brief `summary` of what was accomplished.
- `task_failed`: Mark the current task as failed. Include the `error` message describing what went wrong.
- `run_tests`: Request that tests be run (if configured).

This tool is only available when operating in Bloxy mode (autonomous task execution). After calling task_complete or task_failed, the system will automatically advance to the next task or complete the session.
