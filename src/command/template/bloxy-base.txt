Set the base branch for Bloxy PR operations.

Argument: $ARGUMENTS (branch name, e.g., "main", "develop", "staging")

1. Read `.bloxycode/bloxycode.json` (or `.bloxycode/bloxycode.jsonc`).
2. If the file doesn't exist, inform the user and suggest running `/bloxy-init` first.
3. Update `config.baseBranch` based on the argument:
   - If a branch name is provided, set it as the base branch
   - If no argument is provided, display the current setting
   - If empty string "", auto-detect from remote (default behavior)
4. Save the configuration file.
5. Confirm to the user: "Base branch: [branch-name]" or "Base branch: auto-detect"

The base branch is used for:
- Creating new branches (branches off from base)
- PR target (PRs will merge into base)
- Conflict detection

Example usage:
- `/bloxy-base develop` - Set base branch to develop
- `/bloxy-base main` - Set base branch to main
- `/bloxy-base` - Show current setting
- `/bloxy-base ""` - Reset to auto-detect
