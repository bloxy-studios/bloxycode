Configure branch-per-task mode for Bloxy.

Argument: $ARGUMENTS (expected: "on", "off", "true", "false")

1. Read `.bloxycode/bloxycode.json` (or `.bloxycode/bloxycode.jsonc`).
2. If the file doesn't exist, inform the user and suggest running `/bloxy-init` first.
3. Update `config.branchPerTask` based on the argument:
   - "on", "true" -> true (create a new branch for each task)
   - "off", "false" -> false (work on current branch)
   - If no argument is provided, display the current setting.
4. Save the configuration file.
5. Confirm to the user: "Branch per task: [enabled/disabled]"

When enabled:
- Each task execution starts by creating a new branch
- Branch naming: `bloxy/task-{N}-{task-title-slug}`
- After task completion, the branch is ready for PR
- Use with `/bloxy-pr` to create PRs for each task

Example usage:
- `/bloxy-branch on` - Enable branch per task
- `/bloxy-branch off` - Disable branch per task
- `/bloxy-branch` - Show current setting
