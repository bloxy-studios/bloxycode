Read the project configuration file (`.bloxycode/bloxycode.json` or `.bloxycode/bloxycode.jsonc`).

If it doesn't exist, inform the user that the project is not configured and suggest running `/bloxy-init`.

If it exists:
1. Display the file content in a readable format.
2. Specifically highlight the active `rules` and `capabilities`.
