Preview Bloxy execution without making any changes.

Path: $1 (defaults to PRD.md if not provided)

This is a simulation mode that shows what would happen without actually executing:

1. Parse the PRD file at $1 (or PRD.md)
2. Display parsing results:
   - Total tasks found
   - Pending tasks (to be executed)
   - Completed tasks (will be skipped)
   - Deferred tasks (will be skipped)

3. For each pending task, show:
   - Task number and title
   - Task description/body (if available)
   - What actions would be taken

4. Display configuration that would be used:
   - Test command (if tests enabled)
   - Lint command (if lint enabled)
   - Auto-commit status
   - Max retries setting

5. Show estimated execution plan:
   - "Would execute N tasks"
   - "Would run tests after each task" (if enabled)
   - "Would commit after each task" (if enabled)

6. Do NOT:
   - Execute any tasks
   - Modify any files
   - Create any commits
   - Update the PRD file

Use this to verify your PRD and configuration before running `/bloxy`.

Example usage:
- `/bloxy-dry-run` - Preview with default PRD.md
- `/bloxy-dry-run tasks.md` - Preview with custom file
