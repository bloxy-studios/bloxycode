Enable fast mode for Bloxy - skip both tests and lint.

This is a convenience command that disables both test and lint execution.
Equivalent to running `/bloxy-tests off` and `/bloxy-lint off`.

1. Read `.bloxycode/bloxycode.json` (or `.bloxycode/bloxycode.jsonc`).
2. If the file doesn't exist, inform the user and suggest running `/bloxy-init` first.
3. Set both `config.runTests` and `config.runLint` to false.
4. Save the configuration file.
5. Confirm: "Fast mode enabled: Tests and lint disabled"

To re-enable tests and lint, use:
- `/bloxy-tests on`
- `/bloxy-lint on`

Example usage:
- `/bloxy-fast` - Enable fast mode (skip tests and lint)
