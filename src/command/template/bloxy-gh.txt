Create a PRD from GitHub Issues.

Arguments:
- $1: Repository (e.g., owner/repo) [required]
- $2: Label filter (e.g., "bug", "feature", "enhancement") [optional]

Steps:
1. Verify the `gh` CLI tool is available by running `gh --version`.
   If not installed, inform the user to install it from https://cli.github.com/

2. Build the GitHub CLI command:
   - Base: `gh issue list --repo $1 --state open --limit 20 --json number,title,body,labels`
   - If $2 (label) is provided, add: `--label "$2"`

3. Execute the command and parse the JSON response.

4. Create (or overwrite) `PRD.md` with the following content:

   ```markdown
   # Project Requirements Document (from GitHub)

   ## Overview
   Tasks imported from $1
   Filter: $2 (or "all open issues" if no filter)
   Generated: [current date/time]

   ## Tasks
   - [ ] #<number> <title>
     > <body excerpt if available>
   ```

5. For each issue fetched, append a task entry with:
   - Issue number as reference
   - Issue title
   - First 200 chars of body as indented description (if body exists)

6. Report back:
   - Number of issues imported
   - Label filter used (if any)
   - Path to created PRD file

Example usage:
- `/bloxy-gh owner/repo` - Import all open issues
- `/bloxy-gh owner/repo bug` - Import only issues labeled "bug"
- `/bloxy-gh owner/repo "good first issue"` - Import beginner-friendly issues
