Create a PRD from GitHub Issues.

Repository: $ARGUMENTS (e.g., owner/repo)

1. Verify the `gh` CLI tool is available.
2. Use `gh issue list --repo $ARGUMENTS --state open --limit 20 --json number,title,body` to fetch issues.
3. Create (or overwrite) `PRD.md` with the following content:

   ```markdown
   # Project Requirements Document (from GitHub)

   ## Overview
   Tasks imported from $ARGUMENTS

   ## Tasks
   ```

4. For each issue fetched, append a task entry:
   `- [ ] #<number> <title>`

5. If the body of the issue is not empty, include it as a comment or sub-description indented under the task.

Report back the number of issues imported into the PRD.
