Analyze the current project and perform a complete initialization for the Bloxy agent.

1. **Create `PRD.md`** in ${path} (if it doesn't exist):
   Use this format:
   ```markdown
   # Project Requirements Document

   ## Overview
   [Brief description of the project goal]

   ## Tasks
   - [ ] Task 1: [Description]
   - [ ] Task 2: [Description]
   ...
   ```
   If arguments are provided ("$ARGUMENTS"), use them to populate the tasks. Otherwise, create generic tasks relevant to the codebase.

2. **Create `.bloxycode/bloxycode.json`** (if it doesn't exist):
   Initialize with this default configuration:
   ```json
   {
     "agent": {
       "bloxy": {
         "description": "Autonomous task executor",
         "mode": "primary",
         "permission": {
           "*": "allow",
           "question": "deny"
         }
       }
     },
     "rules": [
       "Follow the existing code style and patterns",
       "Ensure all tests pass before completing a task"
     ],
     "capabilities": {
       "browser": "auto"
     }
   }
   ```

Report back which files were created or if they already existed.
