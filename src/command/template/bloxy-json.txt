Start autonomous task execution from a JSON file: $1

The JSON file should have this format:

```json
{
  "name": "My Project Tasks",
  "description": "Tasks for feature implementation",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "title": "Create user authentication",
      "description": "Implement login and signup endpoints with JWT tokens",
      "completed": false
    },
    {
      "title": "Add password reset flow",
      "description": "Email-based password reset with secure tokens",
      "completed": false
    },
    {
      "title": "Write auth tests",
      "completed": false
    }
  ]
}
```

Steps:
1. Read and parse the JSON file at path $1
2. Validate the structure (must have `tasks` array)
3. Use the bloxy_init tool to initialize the session with the parsed tasks
4. Execute tasks sequentially as in normal `/bloxy` mode
5. Update task `completed` status in the JSON file as tasks complete

If no path is provided, look for `tasks.json` in the current directory.

Example usage:
- `/bloxy-json tasks.json`
- `/bloxy-json project/backlog.json`
