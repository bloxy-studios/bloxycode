Resume the Bloxy session from the last pending or failed task.

If $1 is "--skip-failed", skip any failed tasks and continue with the next pending task.

Steps:
1. Load the session state from .bloxycode/bloxy-state.json
2. If no session exists, inform the user
3. Find the first actionable task:
   - With --skip-failed: Find first "pending" task
   - Without flag: Find first "pending" or "failed" task (for retry)
4. Set the session status to "running"
5. Begin executing from that task
6. Display which task is being resumed

If all tasks are already completed, inform the user that there's nothing to resume.
