Execute a single task directly without a PRD file.

Task: $ARGUMENTS

This is "brownfield mode" - execute one task autonomously and complete.

Steps:
1. Read the current configuration from `.bloxycode/bloxycode.json` (if it exists)
2. Create an in-memory task from the provided description
3. Execute the task following the bloxy agent workflow:
   - Understand the task requirements
   - Plan the implementation approach
   - Implement the task completely
   - Run tests if `config.runTests` is enabled
   - Run lint if `config.runLint` is enabled
   - Commit changes if `config.autoCommit` is enabled
4. Report completion with a summary of what was done

No PRD file is created or modified. This is a one-shot execution.
No state is saved to `.bloxycode/bloxy-state.json`.

Use this command for quick, isolated tasks that don't need tracking.

Example usage:
- `/bloxy-task Add a dark mode toggle to the settings page`
- `/bloxy-task Fix the login form validation bug`
- `/bloxy-task Create unit tests for the auth module`
