Configure test execution for Bloxy mode.

Argument: $ARGUMENTS (expected: "on", "off", "true", "false")

1. Read `.bloxycode/bloxycode.json` (or `.bloxycode/bloxycode.jsonc`).
2. If the file doesn't exist, inform the user and suggest running `/bloxy-init` first.
3. Update `config.runTests` based on the argument:
   - "on", "true" -> true (tests will run after each task)
   - "off", "false" -> false (tests will be skipped)
   - If no argument is provided, display the current setting.
4. Save the configuration file.
5. Confirm to the user: "Test execution: [enabled/disabled]"

Example usage:
- `/bloxy-tests off` - Disable tests
- `/bloxy-tests on` - Enable tests
- `/bloxy-tests` - Show current setting
