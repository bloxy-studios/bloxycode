Validate the PRD file at $1 without executing tasks.

If no path is provided, default to PRD.md.

Use the `bloxy_init` tool with `dryRun: true` to perform the validation.

Report:
- Total tasks found (pending, completed, deferred)
- Any validation errors or warnings (returned by the tool)
- Whether the PRD is ready for execution

Do NOT start executing tasks. This is a dry-run validation only.
