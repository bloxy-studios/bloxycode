Start autonomous task execution from a YAML file: $1

The YAML file should have this format:

```yaml
# Optional project metadata
name: "My Project Tasks"
description: "Tasks for feature implementation"

# Required tasks array
tasks:
  - title: "Create user authentication"
    description: "Implement login and signup endpoints with JWT tokens"
    completed: false

  - title: "Add password reset flow"
    description: "Email-based password reset with secure tokens"
    completed: false

  - title: "Write auth tests"
    completed: false  # description is optional
```

Steps:
1. Read and parse the YAML file at path $1
2. Validate the structure (must have `tasks` array)
3. Use the bloxy_init tool to initialize the session with the parsed tasks
4. Execute tasks sequentially as in normal `/bloxy` mode
5. Update task `completed` status in the YAML file as tasks complete

If no path is provided, look for `tasks.yaml` or `tasks.yml` in the current directory.

Example usage:
- `/bloxy-yaml tasks.yaml`
- `/bloxy-yaml project/sprint-tasks.yml`
