Start autonomous task execution from PRD file: $1

First, use the bloxy_init tool to parse the PRD file and initialize the session.
This will load all tasks and display a summary.

Then, begin executing tasks sequentially. For each task:
1. Read and understand the task requirements
2. Implement the task completely
3. Run tests if configured
4. Commit changes if auto-commit is enabled
5. Signal completion using the bloxy_control tool

Continue until all tasks are complete or an unrecoverable error occurs.

If no PRD path is specified, default to PRD.md in the current directory.
